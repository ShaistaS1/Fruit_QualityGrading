# Fruit_QualityGrading

This project uses computer vision (OpenCV) and deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) to automatically grade fruit quality by analyzing images. It detects fruit type, ripeness, defects, and texture, then provides a quality score (A/B/C). The system includes:

Image preprocessing (resizing, HSV conversion)

CNN model for fruit classification

Defect detection using edge analysis

Interactive Streamlit UI for easy uploading and results visualization

It helps farmers and distributors quickly assess produce quality without manual inspection.
